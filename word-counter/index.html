        <h2>Why Use Our Word Counter Tool?</h2>
        <p>
            Our free word counter is designed specifically for students writing essays, research papers, and academic assignments. 
            Unlike basic word counting tools, we provide comprehensive text analysis including character count, sentence count, 
            reading time estimation, and keyword frequency analysis.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Features That Help Students</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Counting:</strong> See your word count update instantly as you type</li>
            <li><strong>Character Counter:</strong> Toggle between characters with and without spaces for precise requirements</li>
            <li><strong>Reading Time:</strong> Estimate how long your essay takes to read (useful for presentations)</li>
            <li><strong>Page Count:</strong> Know how many pages your essay will be when printed</li>
            <li><strong>Keyword Analysis:</strong> Identify overused words to improve your writing variety</li>
            <li><strong>Auto-Save:</strong> Your work is saved locally, so you won't lose progress</li>
            <li><strong>Essay Type Tips:</strong> Get writing suggestions based on your essay type</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Common Essay Word Count Requirements</h3>
        <p>Different academic levels and essay types have varying word count expectations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High School Essays:</strong> Typically 300-1,000 words</li>
            <li><strong>College Application Essays:</strong> Usually 500-650 words (Common App limit is 650)</li>
            <li><strong>Undergraduate Essays:</strong> Generally 1,000-2,500 words</li>
            <li><strong>Research Papers:</strong> Often 2,500-5,000 words or more</li>
            <li><strong>Graduate Level:</strong> Can range from 3,000-10,000+ words</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tips for Meeting Word Count Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            Struggling to meet your word count? Here are some strategies: expand on your examples with specific details, 
            add relevant quotes from sources, include counterarguments and rebuttals, provide more context for your main points, 
            and ensure each paragraph has thorough analysis. If you're over the limit, focus on removing redundancies, 
            combining similar points, and eliminating filler words.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Understanding Character Counts</h3>
        <p>
            Some assignments specify character limits instead of word counts, especially for online forms, social media posts, 
            or abstracts. Our tool shows both characters with spaces (used by most word processors) and without spaces 
            (used by some academic systems and platforms). Twitter/X posts, for example, have a 280 character limit, 
            while Instagram captions allow up to 2,200 characters.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Privacy and Data Security</h3>
        <p>
            Your privacy matters. This word counter processes all text locally in your browser - we don't upload or store 
            your essays on any server. The auto-save feature saves your work only to your browser's local storage, 
            giving you peace of mind while you write.
